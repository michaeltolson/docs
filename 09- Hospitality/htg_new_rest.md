# Configuring a New Restaurant
# Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to provide a foundational understanding of
the options and capabilities available when configuring a Restaurant
Store.

Often, users would leverage the Template capabilities within Enactor to
set up new and manage existing locations. The use of Templates is
covered in a separate guide. This document will focus on completing the
core configuration steps manually.

## Overview

All activities required to define and configure a new Restaurant Store
is provided here.

This guide will cover the configuration for the following:

-   Restaurant Location

-   Restaurant Areas

-   Device

-   POS Terminal

Region configuration is covered in the **How to configure a base
Organisation Structure** guide.

## Prior Training / Experience

You should be familiar with the following:

-   Estate Manager configuration

-   Data broadcasting

# Restaurant Location 

Enactor supports multiple Location types: Store, Warehouse, Office, and
Restaurant etc. This guide will focus on setting up a new Restaurant
(Hospitality) Location.

## Creating a Restaurant Location 

The location maintenance application can be accessed through:

Configuration -\> Organisation -\> Locations

![](./new_rest/media/image1.png)

![](./new_rest/media/image2.png)

To create a new Restaurant Location, select **Create a New Location** on
the Location Maintenance page**.**

Select the Location type **Restaurant,** from the **Location Type**
drop-down.

No selection should be made for **Template**. The creation and use of
Templates are covered in a separate How-to Guide. This document covers
how to manually configure the mandatory and common settings relating to
location maintenance.

Enter a unique **Location ID** for this location. The ID can be
alphanumeric and contain a maximum of 20 characters.

![](./new_rest/media/image3.png){width="5.25875in" height="2.1525in"}

Select **Create.**

**\*** The Location ID cannot be changed once the Location has been
created.

## Location Maintenance

Numerous tabs and sub-tabs are presented under location maintenance.
This guide is focused on the core Location aspects that are required to
create a restaurant location and the key tabs are **General** and
**Restaurant**.

Address, Purging, Cash Management, Receipt, and Display tabs are briefly
explained within the context of setting up a new restaurant location.

### Location - General Tab

![](./new_rest/media/image4.png)The General tab has all the basic
information that captures the general behaviour and identity of the
restaurant location.

### Location - General Tab - General Sub-tab

Set the appropriate values on the **General** tab as follows:

 | Configuration      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

\*Although all services (Table Service, Bar Service, Takeaway Service)
can be provided in the same area. The standard practice is to have
separate location areas setup for different services. Such as Bar, Main,
Takeaway etc.

# Device Configuration

A device is not merely thought of as a specific hardware item. The
Enactor Device configuration element is considered as a Service Device
representing the software that runs on the hardware. (Which in the case
of a POS is the POS Application). Therefore, multiple devices of diverse
nature may be running on the same physical hardware, which has no fixed
relationship to Location configuration.

The device options can be vast in a restaurant environment. For example,
point of sale devices, mobile devices, handheld terminals, and servers.
All endpoints are of a specific type and need a unique device ID. The
specific device type is used by the process connection diagram to
determine which endpoint to use. Defining a new device type is described
in a separate how-to guide.

Any device that will connect to the Enactor system needs a device type
and a unique device ID.

## Creating a new Device

The Device Maintenance application can be accessed through:

Administration -\> Devices -\> Devices

![](./new_rest/media/image10.png)

![](./new_rest/media/image11.png)

To create a new Device, select **Create a New Device** on the Device
Maintenance page.

Enter a unique device ID for this location. The ID can be alphanumeric
and contain a maximum of 40 characters.

![](./new_rest/media/image12.png)

Select **Create.**

## Device maintenance 

There are three main tabs under Device maintenance application. The
General tab has all the basic information that captures the general
device behaviour and identity of the device.

### Device Maintenance - General Tab

# POS Terminal

All Devices that provide POS Application functionality should have a POS
Terminal configuration. This is associated with the Device ID, which
stores POS Terminal-specific configuration. Therefore, devices should be
configured before configuring a POS terminal.

Each POS Terminal can have unique configuration to support the specific
task that the terminal will perform. This guide will focus on the
Configuration of a restaurant POS Terminal.

## Creating a POS Terminal

The POS Terminal Maintenance application can be accessed through:

Configuration -\> Organisation -\> POS Terminals

To create a new POS Terminal, select **Create New POS Terminal** on the
POS Terminal Maintenance page.

![](./new_rest/media/image16.png)

Select a device ID configured for a restaurant location form the
**Device ID** drop-down list.

Form the **Template** drop-down list you can opt to select the
**Standard Restaurant POS Terminal Template** which will determine the
standard POS terminal functions required by a restaurant. Templates
simplify the process by configuring common element values in a single
place for frequent re-use. Configuring Templates is covered in a
separate how-to guide.

Select **Create.**

\*Only one device can be associated with one POS Terminal.

## POS Terminal maintenance 

Numerous tabs and sub-tabs are presented under POS Terminal maintenance.
This guide is focused on the core aspects that are required to create a
restaurant POS Terminal and the key tabs are **General, Printing, User
Interface,** and **Restaurant.**

### POS Terminal Maintenance - General Tab 

The General tab has all the basic information that captures the general
behaviour and identity of the restaurant POS Terminal.

| Display Launch Menu           | Select this checkbox for the POS Terminal to present an initial Launch Menu. Menu Configuration is covered in a separate How-to Guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Default Launch Event          | This indicates the Launch Screen Event that should automatically be shown to allow for a terminal to display a specific function. This avoids the need for the user to select a specific function such as the Bar Mode View. This option can be used loosely in conjunction with a Restaurant Area, where an area is defined as only supporting bar service, thus the terminal should automatically display the Bar Mode View and not allow select of any other mode. |
