# Introduction

Enactor is a highly flexible and functional Platform. Enabling functionality and therefore making much business change is done by what we call Configuration. Configuration is done in Enactor’s Central Application – **Enactor Estate Manager**. Estate Manager allows for Configuration to be done by non-technical Business Users simply by using a flexible Web UI in a Browser.

You will see this covers **all** Enactor Commerce Applications and Services from Stores Systems, CRM, Promotions and Loyalty to Inventory Management and OMS.
